title: Why LightTs?
description: Discover why LightTs is the right choice for your Node.js projects.

**LightTs** was created to solve the frustration of inconsistent API structures in Express-based development while keeping the simplicity and flexibility of Node.js. Inspired by the OOP structure of NestJS but designed for lightweight projects, LightTs offers a balance of structure, customization, and ease of use. Here’s why developers choose LightTs:

- **No Hidden Magic**: Generates plain Node.js code using standard libraries (e.g., `express`, `jsonwebtoken`, `joi`) that’s easy to understand and modify. For example, adding JWT authentication creates an `auth.ts` file with a straightforward `jsonwebtoken`-based implementation.
- **Full Control**: Generated code is fully editable, avoiding rigid framework patterns.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: The CLI automates project setup, component generation, and feature integration, saving time while preserving flexibility.
- **Standard Libraries**: Uses well-known libraries, reducing the learning curve and ensuring compatibility.
- **Lightweight Alternative**: Perfect for projects where NestJS is overkill, offering structure without complexity.
- **Angular-Style Naming**: Supports Angular-style file naming (e.g., `user.service.ts`) for consistency.
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Built to contribute to the open-source community, welcoming feedback and contributions ([GitHub](https://github.com/taedmonds/lightts)).

Whether you’re building a small API or a large-scale application, LightTs provides the tools to keep your project organized and maintainable without unnecessary complexity.
