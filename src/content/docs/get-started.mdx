description: Learn how to install and set up a LightTs project.

Get up and running with **LightTs**, a lightweight Node.js framework, in just a few steps. This guide walks you through installing the CLI, initializing a project, and generating your first components.

<Steps>

1. **Installation**

    Install the LightTs CLI globally to streamline project setup and management:

    ```bash
    npm install -g lightts
    ```

    Alternatively, use `npx` to run the CLI without global installation:

    ```bash
    npx lightts
    ```

    The CLI supports both `lightts` and `lts` commands. For example:

    ```bash
    lts init
    ```

2. **Initialize a Project**

    Create a new LightTs project with the `init` command:

    ```bash
    lts init
    ```

    The CLI will prompt you to configure your project:

    - **Project Name**: Enter a name (e.g., `my-api`).
    - **File Naming Style**: Choose between Angular-style (`auth.service.ts`) or regular (`auth.ts`) naming conventions.
    - **Features**: Select optional features like JWT authentication, CORS, validation, or database integration.
    - **Database Options**: If database support is selected, choose from PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, or MongoDB, and configure migrations, seeders, or dummy data.
    - **Code Quality Tools**: Optionally set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code consistency.
    - **Package Manager**: Choose npm, Yarn, or pnpm.

    This generates a project structure with all necessary files and configurations.

3. **Generate Components**

    Use the `generate` (or `g`) command to create controllers, services, validators, or resources:

    ```bash
    lts generate controller user
    lts g service auth
    lts g validate user
    lts g resource product
    ```

    These commands create modular, reusable components that follow LightTs conventions.

4. **Run Your Project**

    Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd my-api
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or a custom port if configured).
</Steps>

Done! Your LightTs API is live. Check the [CLI](/cli/) docs for more commands.
