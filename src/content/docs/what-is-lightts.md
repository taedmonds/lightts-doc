description: Understand what LightTs is and its core principles.

**LightTs** is a lightweight, customizable, Node.js-native framework designed for developers who want the simplicity of Express, the structure of NestJS, and the Angular-style naming conventions. Born out of a desire to address the lack of standardization in Express-based API development, LightTs provides a structured yet flexible approach to building APIs without the overhead of heavier frameworks like NestJS. It generates clean, editable code using standard Node.js libraries like `express`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `joi`, ensuring transparency and control.

As an open-source project, LightTs is built for the community by a Node.js developer who values simplicity, OOP principles, and contributing to open-source.
