The **LightTs CLI** is the core tool for managing LightTs projects, providing an intuitive interface for project initialization, component generation, and feature integration. Inspired by NestJS but focused on generating native Node.js code, the CLI ensures simplicity and flexibility.

## Key Commands

- `init`: Initialize a new LightTs project with customizable options.
- `generate` (or `g`): Create controllers, services, validators, or resources.
- `add` (or `a`): Add features like JWT, CORS, validation (Joi), or database support.

## CLI Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: Guides you through project setup with clear questions and options.
- **Flexible Naming**: Supports Angular-style (`auth.service.ts`) or regular (`auth.ts`) file naming.
- **Feature Integration**: Generates customizable, native Node.js code for features.
- **Alias Support**: Use either `lightts` or `lts` for all commands.
